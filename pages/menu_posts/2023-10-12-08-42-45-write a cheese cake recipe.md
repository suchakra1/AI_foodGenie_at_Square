Timestamp: 2023-10-12-08-42-45

**Ingredients:**

For the crust:

* 1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs
* 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, melted
* 1/4 cup granulated sugar

For the filling:

* 8 ounces cream cheese, softened
* 1 cup sugar
* 3 large eggs
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 1/2 cup sour cream
* 1/4 cup heavy cream
* 1/4 cup cornstarch
* 1/4 teaspoon salt

**Instructions:**

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. In a medium bowl, combine the graham cracker crumbs, melted butter, and sugar. Press the mixture into the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan.
3. In a large bowl, beat the cream cheese and sugar together until smooth. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla extract. Add the sour cream, heavy cream, cornstarch, and salt. Beat until smooth.
4. Pour the filling over the crust. Bake for 45-50 minutes, or until the filling is set. Let cool completely before serving.

**Tips:**

* To make sure the crust is evenly cooked, bake it for 5 minutes before adding the filling.
* To prevent the cheesecake from cracking, do not open the oven door while it is baking.
* Let the cheesecake cool completely before serving. This will help it set up properly.
* Enjoy!
