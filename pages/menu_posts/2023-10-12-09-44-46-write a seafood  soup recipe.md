**Tips**

* To make this soup ahead of time, cook the soup according to the directions, then let it cool completely. Store the soup in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. When you're ready to serve, reheat the soup over low heat until warmed through.
* If you don't have any fresh seafood on hand, you can use frozen shrimp and scallops. Just be sure to thaw them completely before adding them to the soup.
* This soup is also delicious with a variety of other vegetables, such as zucchini, mushrooms, or red potatoes. Feel free to add your favorite vegetables to the soup.

**Enjoy!**
