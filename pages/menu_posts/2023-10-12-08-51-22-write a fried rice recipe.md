**Ingredients**

* 2 cups jasmine rice, cooked
* 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
* 1/2 cup chopped onion
* 1/2 cup chopped green bell pepper
* 1/2 cup chopped red bell pepper
* 1/2 cup chopped carrots
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 teaspoon fresh ginger, minced
* 1/2 cup frozen peas and carrots
* 2 eggs, beaten
* 2 tablespoons soy sauce
* 1 teaspoon oyster sauce
* 1/4 teaspoon salt
* 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
* Chopped green onions, for garnish

**Instructions**

1. In a large skillet or wok, heat the oil over medium heat.
2. Add the onion, green bell pepper, red bell pepper, and carrots. Cook until softened, about 5 minutes.
3. Add the garlic and ginger and cook for 1 minute more.
4. Add the frozen peas and carrots and cook until heated through, about 2 minutes.
5. Push the vegetables to the sides of the skillet and add the eggs to the center. Scramble the eggs until cooked through, about 2 minutes.
6. Add the cooked rice to the skillet and stir to combine.
7. Add the soy sauce, oyster sauce, salt, and pepper. Stir to combine.
8. Cook for 1-2 minutes more, or until the rice is heated through.
9. Garnish with chopped green onions and serve immediately.

**Tips**

* To make sure the rice is cooked all the way through, use a rice cooker or cook it according to the package directions.
* If you don't have a wok, you can use a large skillet. Just make sure to use enough oil so that the rice doesn't stick to the pan.
* You can add any vegetables you like to fried rice. Some other popular additions include mushrooms, broccoli, cauliflower, and bok choy.
* If you want a more flavorful fried rice, you can add some chili garlic sauce, Sriracha sauce, or hoisin sauce.
* Fried rice is a great way to use up leftover rice. Just make sure to let the rice cool completely before using it in fried rice.

**Enjoy!**
